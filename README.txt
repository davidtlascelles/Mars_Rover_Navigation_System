System functions based on lucidchart diagrams

- Receive destination coordinates
    749, 574, 1117.56

- Receive current coordinates
    1413, 638, 1097.26

âœ” Create vector from current to destination
    Vector Handler has been created, not tested thorougly. Handles 2D and 3D vectors.
    3D vector direction angle is represented with cylindrical coordinate system angles
    **Lots of changes has been made, I need to fix notation**

- Request topographical data around vector from MPS

* Generate preliminary route (array of waypoint coordinates) from macroscopic topographical data
    Waypoints generate successfuly and are logged into DB unless backtracking event occurs.
    Needs backtracking to handle invalid route
    ** Needs code comments

- Pass vector to imaging system if route established

* Trigger backtracking if route not established
    Currently a print statement in Pathfinder.py -> travel_direction function
    ** Needs code comments

* Handle backtracking (reacalling vectors and waypoints, reversing them to last checkpoint waypoint)
    Need to figure out backtracking logic

- Inject hazard avoidance waypoints into preliminary route waypoint array

* Cache safe checkpoint waypoint
    DB functional, need to write logic for when to save a checkpoint
    ** Has decent code comments, could improve

- Create vectors along route
    Should be easy after waypoint db is created. Vector system ready

- Pass vectors to drive system
