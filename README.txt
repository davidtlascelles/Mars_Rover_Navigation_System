System functions based on lucidchart diagrams

- Receive destination coordinates
    749, 574, 1117.56

- Receive current coordinates
    1413, 638, 1097.26

âœ” Create vector from current to destination
    Vector Handler has been created, not tested thorougly. Handles 2D and 3D vectors.
    3D vector direction angle is represented with cylindrical coordinate system angles

- Request topographical data around vector from MPS

* Generate preliminary route (array of waypoint coordinates) from macroscopic topographical data
    I'm working on this now
- Pass vector to imaging system if route established
* Trigger backtracking if route not established
    Also working on this
* Handle backtracking (reacalling vectors and waypoints, reversing them to last checkpoint waypoint)
    Also this

- Inject hazard avoidance waypoints into preliminary route waypoint array

* Cache safe checkpoint waypoint
    Just started trying to figure out an SQLite db for this

- Create vectors along route
    Should be easy after waypoint db is created. Vector system ready

- Pass vectors to drive system
